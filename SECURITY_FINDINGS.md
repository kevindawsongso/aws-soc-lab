🛡️ Security Findings – AWS SOC Lab

This lab deployed a honeypot-backed EC2 instance monitored by CloudWatch and Splunk. External scans and attacks were simulated using tools like Hydra, Nikto, and Nmap, with AWS GuardDuty capturing real-world probes.

🔍 Summary of Key Detections
	•	GuardDuty Alerts:
	•	🔐 SSH brute-force attempts from Pakistan and India (198.38.88.182, 110.39.169.73)
	•	📡 Port probes against ports 445 (SMB), 3306 (MySQL), 1433 (SQL Server), and 23 (Telnet) from Censys, Huawei Cloud, and IPVolume
	•	⚠️ S3 bucket misconfiguration: Public read access detected via PutBucketPolicy by IAM user gsocyberadmin
	•	🚨 Root API usage: Detected DeleteSession API activity from unrecognized IP in Winston-Salem, indicating poor credential hygiene
	•	Hydra FTP brute-force:
	•	16 common credentials successfully cracked against FTP service at 54.90.164.244 (e.g., admin:123456, admin:iloveyou)
	•	Nikto Scan Results:
	•	Missing security headers: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
	•	HTTP methods allowed: OPTIONS, GET, POST, HEAD
	•	Directory traversal vectors observed: /./, /%2e/, /%2f/
	•	Nmap Results:
(See nmap_scan_results_713.md for full port/service details)

📦 Recommendations Based on Findings
	•	Harden SSH access with key-only authentication and NACL restrictions.
	•	Disable unused services: FTP, Telnet, SQL ports should be blocked by default.
	•	Enforce strict S3 bucket policies using BlockPublicAccess.
	•	Avoid root key usage—use IAM roles and enforce MFA.
	•	Integrate GuardDuty and CloudWatch alert logs into Splunk dashboards for correlation.
